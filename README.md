# E155 Lab 5
This repository includes MCU code that interfaces with a quadrature encoder to measure position and speed. The code uses TIM1 for encoder input and TIM6 for periodic sampling. The position is calculated based on the encoder pulses, and speed is derived from the change in position over time.
